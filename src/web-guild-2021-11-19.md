# string vs union of string literals
Try to narrow a type from just `string` to a union of string literals.

E.g. instead of typing `size` as `string`:

```tsx
// BAD
const BalloonComponent = ({ size }: { size: string }) => {
  if (size === 'small') {
    //
  } else if (size === 'medium') {
    //
  } else if (size === 'large') {
  }
  return <div className={styles[size]}>Balloon</div>;
};
```

type it as a the union `'small' | 'medium' | 'large'`:
```tsx
// GOOD
const BalloonComponent = ({ size }: { size: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' }) => {
  // ...
};
```

# Utility Types
These are built-in Typescript types that help transform one type to another to save you from copying and pasting code, and also reduce chances of error.

Reference - [https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#recordkeys-type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#recordkeys-type)

## Omit
```tsx
type Balloon = {
  id: string;
  color: string;
  size: string;
  name: string;
};

type T1 = Omit<Balloon, 'id'>;
```

`T1` is now equivalent to `Balloon` but with the `'id'` property removed.

## Exclude
Use exclude to remove members from a union.

```tsx
type Fruits = 'papaya' | 'mango' | 'durian';
type FragrantFruits = Exclude<Fruits, 'durian'>;
```

`FragrantFruits` is now equal to `'papaya' | 'mango'`, i.e. `'durian'` has been removed.

Watch out when using `Omit` on a union as it acts on properties, in this case the string methods.

```tsx
type FragrantFruits = Omit<Fruits, 'durian'>;
```

`FragrantFruits` is probably not what we want - it now has the properties of the string class.

```tsx
// The resultant type:
type FragrantFruits = {
    [x: number]: string;
    toString: () => string;
    charAt: (pos: number) => string;
    charCodeAt: (index: number) => number;
    concat: (...strings: string[]) => string;
    indexOf: (searchString: string, position?: number) => number;
    ... 40 more ...;
    trimEnd: () => string;
}
```

## Pick
Pick the properties from the type that you need.

```tsx
type ComplexUserType = {
  name: string;
  favorites: string[];
  type: 'super' | 'read-only' | 'regular';
};

type T2 = Pick<ComplexUserType, 'type'>;

// T2 is now equal to the following:
type T2 = {
    type: 'super' | 'read-only' | 'regular';
}
```

`Pick` is useful for picking many properties. If you just need one, you can use the bracket notation:
```tsx
type T2 = ComplexUserType['type'];
// T2 is now equal to:
type T2 = 'super' | 'read-only' | 'regular';
```

## Partial
Make all properties on a type optional.
```tsx
type T3 = Partial<ComplexUserType>;
// T3 is now equal to:
type T3 = {
    name?: string;
    favorites?: string[];
    type?: 'super' | 'read-only' | 'regular';
}
```

## Required
Make all properties on a type required.

We can reverse the above by applying `Required`
```tsx
type T4 = Required<T3>;
// T4 is now equal to:
type T4 = {
    name: string;
    favorites: string[];
    type: 'super' | 'read-only' | 'regular';
}
```

# Object-like types
When you want to declare that something is an object, use `Record<string, unknown>` as a default. Using `{}` or `Object` or even `object` is, despite what it seems, not what you want. Underneath, `Record<string, unknown>` is equivalent to `{ [k: string]: unknown }`

```tsx
const func1 = (value: {}) => {
  if (value.x) {} // Type error
};
const func2 = (value: Object) => {
  if (value.x) {} // Type error
};
const func3 = (value: Record<string, unknown>) => {
  if (value.x) {} // Good
};
const func4 = (value: { [key: string]: unknown } /* Same as above */) => {
  if (value.x) {} // Good
};
```

# Unknown
Use `unknown` to unblock yourself from the compiler. Whenever a type must be explicitly declared but you do not really need to know what it is, use `unknown`. It is the safe equivalent to `any` - it can be any type, but must first be narrowed in order to be used.

```tsx
const func4 = (value: Record<string, unknown>) => {
  if (value.x) {
    // Since value.x is unknown, we need to narrow it first before using it.
    if (typeof value.x === 'string') {
      // Now the compiler knows x is a string
      return parseInt(value.x, 10);
    }
  }
};
```

If we had however typed it as `any`, the compiler would have let us use `value.x` as a string without complaint, even if at runtime it really isn't, which could cause a runtime crash.

`unknown` is also really useful when converting a JS/JSX file to TS/TSX

# Function-like types
Similar to objects, functions should be typed as `(arg types) => return type` instead of using `Function`

```tsx
// BAD
const func5 = (callback: Function) => {
  callback(9000);
};

// GOOD
const func6 = (callback: (...args: unknown[]) => unknown) => {};
const func7 = (callback: (value: number) => void) => {};
```

# extends
You can think of the `extends` keyword in Typescript generics to mean "equal to or more specific than" and that it defines the type of the type argument, similar to defining the type on a function argument.

```tsx
type T<M extends 'small' | 'large'> = {
  [k: string]: M;
};
```
Here the type parameter passed to `T` should be equal to `'small' | 'large'` or more specific than, e.g. `'small'`

# Custom class constructors
Sometimes classes do a lot of dynamic property manipulation and the compiler can't infer what the result should be. You can first declare your class:

```tsx
class __Constants__ {
  [key: string]: string;
  constructor(values: string[]) {
    values.forEach((key) => {
      this[key] = key;
    });
  }
}
```

Note the dynamic property creation in the constructor. Then you can expose the class as a different value and cast it with a constructor:

```tsx
const Constants = __Constants__ as {
  new <T extends readonly string[]>(values: T): { [k in T[number]]: k };
};
```

Now when using the `Constants` class, the compiler knows what properties the resultant object should have:
```tsx
const __colors__ = ['BLUE', 'GREEN'] as const;

const Colors = new Constants(__colors__);
const Colors2 = new __Constants__(['BLUE', 'GREEN']);
// const Colors: {
//   BLUE: "BLUE",
//   GREEN: "GREEN",
// }
```

# infer
`infer` is used to declare a type variable inside a condition clause, such as for generics that require one or more type parameters that you don't know or don't need to know what they are. Here we can use it to unwrap the inner type of a Promise:

```tsx
type UnwrapPromise<T> = T extends Promise<infer P> ? P : never;
type T5 = UnwrapPromise<Promise<string[]>>;
// T5 is now equal to
type T5 = string[];
```
